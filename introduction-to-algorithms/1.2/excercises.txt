1. The app for the Uber can calculate the approximate arrival time.
The function of the algorithm here is by having current location of the driver and the location of the client
and probably some other data to calculate the arrival time. The same can be said about the route.
2.
8n^2  vs  64n lgn
~ 43 merge sort beats insertion sort
3.
2^n = 32768, 100 n^2 = 22500
2^n = 16384, 100 n^2 = 19600
so the n = 15
