T(n) = 2, if n = 2
       2T(n/2) + n, if n = 2^k, k > 1
prove by math induction that T(n) = n lg n

0. prove that it holds for n = 2 => 2 lg 2 = 2 * 1 = 2
1. induction step

suppose that:
2f(k/2) + k = k lg(k) is OK
let's prove for 2*k:
2f(k) + 2k = 2k lg(2k)
             2k (1 + lg(k))
             2k + 2k lg(k)
2f(k) = 2k lg(k)
f(k) = k lg(k)
f(k) = 2f(k/2) + k  - and that's our original equation
