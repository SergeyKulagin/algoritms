def linear-search(A, v)
res = NIL
for i = 1 to A.length
    if(v == A[i])
        res = i
        return res
return res

loop invariant - on each step the result is either NIL (if it's not found) or the index

1) initialization
Before loop iteration we haven't searched yet so logically res is NIL
2) maintenance
On each iteration step we preserve NIL or immediately return with the index if the result is found
3) termination
The loop reaches termination only in case no corresponding value was found, res preserves NIL in that case
