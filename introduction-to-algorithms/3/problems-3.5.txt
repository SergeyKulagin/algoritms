a)
f(n) and g(n) are asymptotically nonnegative.

Either is true:
- f(n) <= c g(n) , c exists, n >= n0
- f(n) >= c g(n) , c exists, for infinite n numbers (omega infinity)
- both

a function (here) can be either monotonic increasing, decreasing, fluctuating (like sin, cos)
1. if one of the functions is monotonic increasing or decreasing the conjecture is true
cause we can use limit.
b. if 1 of the functions is fluctuation the omega infinity holds with specific constants
though big omeg not because it have n > n0


b)
omega-infinity - defines asymptotic lower bound for n> n0
big-omega   - defines asymptotic lower bound for infinite number of n

the omega-infinity works for infinite number of sizes
the big-omega works for sizes of input n > n0

the big-omega can show how the algorithm behaves for big enough input sizes
while omega-infinity shows how the algorithm behaves based on the number of calls of the alogrithm

c) todo
