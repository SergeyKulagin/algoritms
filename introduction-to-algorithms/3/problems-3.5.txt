a)
f(n) and g(n) are asymptotically nonnegative.

Either is true:
- f(n) <= c g(n) , c exists, n >= n0
- f(n) >= c g(n) , c exists, for infinite n numbers (omega infinity)
- both

a function (here) can be either monotonic increasing, decreasing, fluctuating (like sin, cos)
1. if one of the functions is monotonic increasing or decreasing the conjecture is true
cause we can use limit.
b. if 1 of the functions is fluctuation the omega infinity holds with specific constants
though big omeg not because it have n > n0
