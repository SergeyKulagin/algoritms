4.2-1
Done on the paper,  double-checked with algorithm

4.2-2
done in the code

4.2-3
Extend the matrix to be exact power of 2 with 0  - see code
The algorithm has the same complexity as the original Strassen's:
since we extend the original matrices on 1 dimensions in the theta notation
the complexity remains the same. Plus extending the matrices takes complexity
proportional to n which is ignored in theta notation.
