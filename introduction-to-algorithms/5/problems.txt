Let's say we have a set of candidates R. Since according to the algorithm for each pair of candidates a, b we can
define relation R which is the best and it means the A is a total relation that have total order.

The implementation could call RANDOM(0,1) b-a times and add the results to a
The running time is f(b-a)
