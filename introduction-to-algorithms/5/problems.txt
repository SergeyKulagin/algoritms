Let's say we have a set of candidates R. Since according to the algorithm for each pair of candidates a, b we can
define relation R which is the best and it means the A is a total relation that have total order.

The implementation could call RANDOM(0,1) b-a times and add the results to a
The running time is f(b-a)

Since number of permutations of the candidates is n! (uniform random permutations) for to chose only 1 it
should go first we have 1 permutation for that. So probability is 1/n!
Similarly for choosing n candidates. The should be sorted from lowest rank to highest and there is only
1 permutation for that. So probability is 1/n! also.
